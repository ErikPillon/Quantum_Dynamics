# Quantum_Dynamics
Quantum Dynamics script for the time evolution of the wavepacket in the case of the Tully article

The full quantum evolution of a wavepacket is evaluated in the case of the first type model in the article Tully, J.C. _J. Chem. Phys._ (1990) *93* 1061.

In particular, the Adiabatic case is transformed into the adiabatic case, the UNitary time evolution operator is managed using the Trotter decomposition formula and the Kinetic Energy Operator is handled in the Fourier space.

## Requirements
The full code has been written in Python 3.7 by means of the conda notebook. `numpy` is needed for a correct execution of the code.
